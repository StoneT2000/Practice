# Programming Techniques / Cheat Sheet / Tips

## Data Structures

### Array Based:

Using differences in values allow you to store more information with one element in an array

Consider adding 3 to A[i…j], its equivalent to storing 3 into A[i] and when looping through A, just add A[i]'s as you go to get A[i+1], so sum of A[1…i] = A[i+1]

### Graph Based:

## Algorithms

### Sorting:

### Searching:

## Dynamic Programming
